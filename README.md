# CS474_JAARS
CS 474 Team Project

A personal photography collection application. The photographic content is immaterial (keep it clean) so the content would largely depend on the availability of a suitable API.  This is a single-user application, there is no need for authentication. The storage of photos and metadata must be persistent. The project must be setup using only free resources such as free APIs, no fees for storage, computing, etc.

Will be using a FLASK, and our API is Giphy Developers, we will be using SQLite as our database.

  -Hard put photos into application
  -Find API and test that calls work
